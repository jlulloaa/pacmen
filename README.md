# Description of the Project (minimum of 20 words)
It's time for another exploratory exercise! Remember how you were able to manipulate the movements of PacMan across the browser window? In this exercise, you are going to create PacMen with the click of a button and each of them will move about the browser window at their own pace. Enjoy this challenge!

In this exercise, you will create a web page that produces a PacMan on the click of a button by using the array methods you've learned previously and the new techniques you’ve learned for manipulating the DOM.

Here you can see what the PacMen exercise will look like after it's been implemented. You will complete this exercise in Canvas and then you can also create it on your local machine and share it on your personal GitHub repository by using the starter files from the Introduction and Instructions page.


Here's how the game is played:

When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.
The starter code includes comments to guide you through this activity.

hint: remember that window.innerWidth provide the width of the web page, you can use this value to detect if a pacman is at the edge of the screen

Making multiple Pacmen
In a previous assignment, you were able to create a pacman and make it move across the screen. In this activity, we're going to take that a step further.

Your task in this activity is to create a pacman on demand (button click) and move these pacmen across the page

By the end you should have something that behaves like this:
